# Topic_Summaries

Welcome to the Topic Summaries repository! This repository serves as a collection of my notes and cheatsheets on various ML-related topics. The notes are based on Kaggle courses and other learning resources, and they contain useful code snippets that I have found during my learning journey. Each file in this repository represents a specific topic and contains relevant code snippets and explanations.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a collection of `.py` files, with each file representing notes and code snippets for a specific topic. The files are named after the corresponding topics and cover various ML-related subjects, including:

- Machine Learning fundamentals
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Popular ML-related libraries (e.g., pandas, seaborn)
- Deep dives into specific ML concepts and techniques

Please note that the files in this repository are primarily intended as personal notes and cheatsheets, rather than self-contained executable scripts. They serve as quick references and reminders of key concepts and code snippets that I found helpful during my learning process.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and review the `.py` files corresponding to the topics that interest you. Each file contains code snippets, explanations, and examples related to the specific topic. You can use them as references or study materials to reinforce your understanding of the ML concepts covered.

Please remember that these files are not intended as comprehensive tutorials or standalone scripts. They are meant to supplement your learning journey and provide helpful code snippets and explanations.
